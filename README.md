Spectroscopy
is one of the oldest techniques used in analytical chemistry, but it is also used
for lighting quality control. The exercise consists in learning the techniques of chemical analysis and examining the emission spectrum commonly used
sources of white light and determining, among others, which of them best suits the human eye.
